iptables has numerous upstream sources used to create the actual
Debian package. All of those pristine sources are in the upstream
subdirectory of this archive. The linux kernel sources have been
pruned to just the COPYRIGHT, MAINTAINER, and CREDITS files along
with netfilter directories and files.

To unpack and prepare everything, run "make" in the top directory.
Be aware that the results are all expanded to a temporary work
space, debian/build/, and the prep.sh script has no provision for 
reversing anything.

Select patch-o-matic patches are applied to the kernel source tree
that is unpacked into debian/build/; however, the kernel source trees
used to build the iptables packages are absolutely NOT left in a
state intended for any particular use beyond the iptables package
build. And some of the patching is entirely pointless.

Current local patches/* patches applied to source code:

  all/###-link_with_gcc.patch  
    
    link with gcc instead of ldd, Bug#12271, addresses build failure 
    on HP and other archs. Courtesy of Lamont Jones.
     http://bugs.debian.org/122712

  all/###-weird_spelling.patch

    spelling correction, s/wierd/weird/

  all/###-weird_character.patch

    avoid "weird character" warning for interface names that contain
    dashes

  all/###-man_pages.patch

    sed 's/is the examined/is examined/' iptables.8.old > iptables.8
    also adds information about the default logging level

  hppa/###-atomic_t_silly_hack.patch
  s390/###-atomic_t_silly_hack.patch

    This is a silly, possibly detrimental hppa and s390 hack, which 
    copies the atmomic_t typedef out of /usr/include/asm/atom.h 
    instead of including that header. If anyone knows how to fix the 
    FTBFS in Bug#232418 (http://bugs.debian.org/232418), please mail 
    iptables@packages.debian.org.
