----

== Only one active VPNease profile at a time ==

Windows 2000 L2TP/IPsec has a practical limitation that only one IPsec connection profile
can be used at a time.  For VPNease connections this means that only the most recently
autoconfigured VPNease profile can be used.  If you need to use multiple connections, you
should run VPNease autoconfigure each time you change between profiles.

----

== Changing IP address ==

When the IP address of your Windows 2000 client changes (e.g. you connect to a new
network, or change from LAN to wireless LAN), it may be take up to 5 minutes for your
VPNease connection to recover.  During this time the VPNease connection setup will time
out because Windows 2000 is using the old IPsec connection instead of establishing a new
one.  This is a built-in limitation of the Windows 2000 IPsec implementation.  You can
speed up the process by rebooting the computer, after which you can reconnect immediately.

----

== MTU provided by VPNease server is ignored by Windows 2000 client ==

VPNease server provides VPN clients a Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) setting, which ensures
that packets sent through the Internet are not fragmented.  It also ensures that any
TCP connections established by a client computer use a suitable TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS)
which ensures that TCP segments sent through the VPN connection do not need fragmentation
on their way to the destination host.

Windows 2000 VPN client ignores the MTU setting sent by the VPNease server.  This causes
Windows 2000 to e.g. send TCP segments larger than optimal, causing some fragmentation of
the TCP segments.  This should not cause problems other than sub-optimal use of network
resources.  However, if intervening routers or firewalls are configured to block ICMP
packets, which are used to signal about too large packets, silent connectivity
issues may arise.
