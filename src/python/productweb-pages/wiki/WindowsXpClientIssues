== Windows XP Home Edition does not support IPsec prior to SP2 ==

Windows XP Home Edition does not support IPsec connections prior to SP2.
Because VPNease uses IPsec-based L2TP/IPsec connections, VPNease cannot be
used in Windows XP Home Edition computers which do not have Service Pack 2 (SP2)
installed.

Workaround: install Windows XP Home Edition SP2.
