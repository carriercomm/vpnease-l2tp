          End User shall not have any rights to the Software (not even
          the right to use the services provided by the Partner) or

          in each End User License Agreement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a)
            The Software and all related material are the property of

          </li>
          <li>
            c)
            The right of use granted by the End User License Agreement
            only applies to the use of the Software and any written
            material based on the Software in the End User's own
            internal operations. The right of use covers current
            version of the Software and possible bug fixes. However,
            the right of use does not cover new versions of the
            Software.
          </li>
          <li>
            d)
            The Software, or any part thereof (including written
            material and other related material) may not, even partly,
            be transferred, sold, leased, licensed, lent, copied,
            modified, amended, further developed, adapted, included in
            other products, software or services or compiled without
            the express prior written consent of Codebay Oy and/or its

            necessary for customary use of the Software.
          </li>
          <li>
            e)

            take any action that is intended to, even partly,
            determine or discover the functioning, data structures,
            protocols, interfaces or the source code of the Software
            or any part thereof.

            or any related material may not be removed.
          </li>
          <li>
            g)
            The End User does not have any right to use or any other
            right to the Software's trademark or any other related
            trademark or other mark.

          <li>

            Codebay Oy VPNease end user license agreement (available
            at www.vpnease.com). In case the End User continues using
            the Software after the termination of the End User License
            Agreement, the End User shall have a direct contractual
            relation to Codebay Oy and the terms and conditions of the
            Codebay Oy VPNease end user license agreement shall
            apply. Codebay Oy has the right to make changes to the
            Codebay Oy VPNease end user license agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            j)
            End User License Agreement shall terminate immediately in
            case the End User breaches the abovementioned license
            terms or the license terms mentioned in Clause 4.3 or 4.4
            hereto.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          4.3
          When the Partner provides End Users with a copy of the
          Software, the Partner shall include the following term in
          each End User License Agreement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a)
            The right of use granted by the End User License Agreement
            permits the use of one active installation (copy) of the
            Software at a time. Every installation (such as copy of
            Software running on virtual server) requires a separate
            license. The End User has a right to use the Software and
            all related material as granted by these terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          4.4
          When the Partner provides End Users with service based on
          the Software (software as a service), the Partner shall
          include the following term in each End User License
          Agreement:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            a)
            The right of use granted by the End User License Agreement
            permits the use of the Software as part of the Services.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          4.5
          The Partner shall terminate the End User License Agreement
          with immediate effect in case the End User has breached the
          abovementioned terms and conditions. If the Partner has not
          terminated the End User Agreement within fourteen (14) days
          from the date of breach, the failure in terminating the End
          User License Agreement is considered to be a material breach
          of this Partner License Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          4.6
          When drafting the terms and conditions of the End User
          License Agreement and when entering into a license agreement
          with an End User the Partner shall take into account that
          this Partner License Agreement is valid only for a limited
          period. The Partner shall take into account especially the
          facts that the Company is entitled to terminate this Partner
          License Agreement giving six month's notice and under
          certain circumstances this Partner License Agreement may be
          terminated with immediate effect or with a very short term
          of notice.
        </p>

        <p>
          4.7
          The terms and conditions in Clauses 4.2-4.6 shall apply to
          situations where the End User acquires its right to use the
          Software from the Partner, i.e. the contractual relation
          concerning the right of use during the production use phase
          is between the End User and the Partner. When the Partner
          provides End Users only with installation service, end user
          training and/or demonstrates the functionalities of the
          Software to End Users in accordance with the terms and
          conditions of this Partner License Agreement the Partner is
          not obliged to draft an End User License Agreement and enter
          into it with the End User. However, the Partner shall see to
          it that the End User accepts the terms and conditions of
          Codebay Oy VPNease end user license agreement.

          Any notice required to be given by the Company to the
          Partner pursuant to this agreement may be sent to the
          Partner by e-mail. Correctly addressed notices sent by email
          shall be deemed to have received instantaneously on
          transmission.
        </p>

        <p>
          7.3
          If the Company notices that the Partner's e-mail address is
          not valid or up-to-date, the Company is entitled to
          terminate this agreement with immediate effect.

          <strong class="cb-bold">8. AMENDMENTS</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          8.1
          The Company is entitled to make changes to the terms and
          conditions of this Partner License Agreement. The changes
          shall be binding on the parties after a six (6) months
          period from notice. If the Partner does not agree to abide
          by the changes in the terms and conditions, the right to use
          the Software and to grant rights to use the Software ceases
          as the six (6) months period has passed.
        </p>

        <p>
          8.2
          If any of the provisions of the terms and conditions of this
          Partner License Agreement shall be unenforceable and/or
          invalid, such unenforceability and/or invalidity shall not
          render the terms and conditions unenforceable or invalid as
          a whole. Any provision determined to be unenforceable or
          invalid shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent
          permitted by applicable law. The Company will amend or
          replace such provision with one that is valid and
          enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the
          original objective and intent as reflected in the original
          provision.
