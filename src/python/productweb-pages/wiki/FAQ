== How can I test VPNease? ==

To test the product you need to install the VPNease server to a 
physical computer or into a virtual machine (provided by a supported virtualization product). You can 
then test remote access connections from your client computers or try the site-to-site connections 
provided by VPNease. When installed, VPNease 
automatically allocates a demo license which does not require any registration. 
If you accept our legal terms, you can test the product without other obligations for the demo period. 
For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/download-home.html VPNease Download].

If you want to test client compatibility without installing VPNease server,  
you can test your client computers against our test servers.  
For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/test-servers.html Test Servers].

== VPNease server does not boot after installation ==

There are several reasons which may cause server boot to fail after installation: 

  * VPNease was installed with multiple hard disks connected. 
    In some cases this may lead to boot problems with some BIOS models. Please reinstall 
    the product with only one hard disk connected.

  * The VPNease boot loader ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRUB GRUB])
    may have a problem with your BIOS drive settings. 
    You can try to change BIOS settings or reinstall the product with only one hard disk 
    connected. As a final measure, you can install the product using a virtualization product. 
    For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/virtualization-products.html Virtualization Products].

  * Your BIOS does not support booting from hard disks larger than 512 MB. This is typically 
    manifested as Grub error !#18. See: [#Gruberror18whenbootingafterinstallation Grub error #18 when booting after installation].

----

== VPNease does not detect my network interface (NIC) ==

VPNease does not support non-Ethernet network interfaces such as ADSL modems.  
Such network interfaces are not recognized in the administrator interface. If your network interface supports Ethernet, 
it may be unsupported by the Ubuntu platform used by VPNease server. 
To overcome this problem, try another network interface model or use a virtualization product. 

For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/server-requirements.html Server Requirements] for hardware compatibility, and  
[http://www.vpnease.com/virtualization-products.html Virtualization Products] for a list of supported virtualization products. 

----

== VPNease does not detect my hard disk ==

VPNease should automatically detect and support IDE, Serial ATA (SATA), SCSI, and 
USB storage devices. If your hard disk is one of these types and is not detected, please review your BIOS settings and 
cabling. You can also check whether other operating systems detect the device to ensure that the device is connected 
correctly. 

VPNease does not support software or hardware (or hybrid) RAID devices. 
If your BIOS provides a RAID function, try to disable RAID from BIOS. If you are using a separate RAID 
controller, you can also try to configure the RAID controller into a "plain disk mode" where individual hard 
disks are directly exposed to the host computer. 

In case you cannot get the hard disk to work with VPNease installer, try another 
hard disk model or another disk controller. You can also use a virtualization product to overcome this limitation. See 
[http://www.vpnease.com/virtualization-products.html Virtualization Products] for a list of supported virtualization products. 

----

== Grub error !#18 when booting after installation ==

[http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18 Grub error #18]
is typically caused by old BIOS 
versions which do not support large hard disks (over 512 megabytes). VPNease requires 
a BIOS capable of booting from at least a 2 GB hard drive. 
You can work around this problem by installing a host operating system (e.g. Windows or Linux) and using virtualization 
for installing the VPNease server; however, we suggest you use more modern hardware. 
 
----

== VPNease server reboots periodically after installation ==

The VPNease has an internal watchdog which reboots the server once in a while 
whenever the server does not seem to be functioning correctly. If the server has been installed but has not 
been configured with a working IP address (and DHCP is not providing an address), the server will periodically 
reboot because it cannot establish working network parameters. 

Solution: configure network settings for the server from the Networking
page of the administrator interface. 
 
----

== RADIUS authentication works for VPN connections but not for user web interface connections ==

This problem is typically caused by RADIUS server misconfiguration. The two most common configuration errors are: 

  * RADIUS server responds to RADIUS MSCHAPv2 authentication (used for Windows client authentication) but does not respond to 
    RADIUS PAP authentication (used for web authentication). 

  * RADIUS server responds correctly to Service-Type Framed-User (VPN authentication) but responds incorrectly to 
    Service-Type Authenticate-Only (web authentication). 

For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/authentication-options.html Authentication Options].

----

== My site-to-site connection does not work correctly ==

Site-to-site connections involve configuration of several devices, such as VPNease 
servers, routers, and firewalls. Typically it is straightforward to configure the site-to-site connection itself. 
You can verify that the site-to-site connection itself works by ensuring that the VPNease 
administrator interface reports the connection to be up. After that, problems are typically related to routing and 
firewall configuration. 

See [http://www.vpnease.com/site-to-site-configuration.html Site-to-Site Configuration] for configuration and 
troubleshooting guidance. 

----

== What Dynamic DNS providers are supported by VPNease? ==

VPNease currently supports:
  * [http://www.dyndns.com/ DynDNS]
  * [http://www.dhs.org/ DHS International]
  * [http://www.ods.org/ Open Domain Server]
  * [http://www.dyns.cx/ DyNS]

----

== How can I authenticate VPN users against a Windows server? ==

Windows servers, such as Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008, can 
be used for VPN user authentication through the 
[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/network/ias/default.mspx Internet Authentication Service (IAS)] Windows component. 
IAS provides a RADIUS interface to the Windows Server, which VPNease can use 
for user authentication. 

For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/authentication-options.html Authentication Options].

----
 
== How can I monitor VPNease server with SNMP? ==

You need to enable SNMP from the VPNease administrator interface 
(License & Maintenance -> SNMP Monitoring), configure a  
SNMP community string (Password), 
download the [http://www.vpnease.com/latest-version.html VPNease MIB] file, 
and configure your SNMP monitoring server accordingly. 
 
For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/snmp-monitoring.html SNMP Monitoring].

----

== Does VPNease support server clustering or high availability? ==

Yes, VPNease supports server clustering. You can install multiple 
servers and use DNS-based load balancing and failover to provide both high throughput and high 
availability. DNS-based load balancing scales essentially without a limit on the server count. 
Individual servers don't even need to be in the same physical server network, alleviating bandwidth 
constraints. 

For more information, see [http://www.vpnease.com/server-clustering.html Server Clustering].

----

== Does VPNease support Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)? ==

Some of the supported operating systems, like Windows XP, have limitations in Internationalized Domain Names support. 
To avoid client operating system problems, VPNease does not support Internationalized Domain Names. 

----

== How should the VPN client address range be configured? ==

The client address range is configured from VPNease server network 
configuration page, and determines which IP addresses are assigned to VPN client connections. The 
assigned address is visible to a VPN client as the IP address of the VPN network interface, and is  
the address that is used "inside" the VPN connection. 

The client address range is only used by the VPNease when assigning 
addresses dynamically to users without a fixed IP address (either manually configured or provided 
by a RADIUS server using the Framed-IP-Address attribute). For the same reason, manually configured 
or RADIUS server assigned fixed IP addresses must not be contained in the configured client address 
range. 

Site-to-site connections require careful configuration of client address ranges. The client address 
range of initiating peer and the responding peer must not overlap. If they do overlap, the site-to-site 
connection will fail during connection formation and will be dropped. A later retry will have similar 
fate, resulting in periodic connection attempts that fail silently. 

Finally, the lowest and two highest addresses of the client subnet may not be used for either the 
client range or for fixed IP addresses. For instance, if the client subnet is configured as 
192.168.100.0/24, the following addresses cannot be used: 192.168.100.0, 192.168.100.254, 192.168.100.255. 
The lowest and highest addresses are IP subnet and broadcast address, respectively, while the second to 
highest address is reserved for the server end of the PPP connection. 

In summary: for the simplest configuration, assign a separate client subnet for each VPNease 
server (involved in site-to-site connections), and assign all fixed IP addresses (locally configured or RADIUS Framed-IP-Address) 
outside every configured range (though such addresses may be inside a certain client subnet). 
This ensures that ranges and reserved addresses never overlap and cause connectivity issues. In particular, there will be 
no site-to-site connectivity problems caused by overlapping addresses

== Why does my VPNease server connect to management.vpnease.com? ==

The VPNease server connects to a host named management.vpnease.com for various 
product management functions: to obtain a demo license, to authenticate a purchased license, 
to provide time synchronization, and to check and receive product updates. Only information covered in the 
product <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> is transferred to management.vpnease.com. 
In particular, usernames, passwords, or other configuration settings are never transferred. 
All data transferred between the VPNease server and management.vpnease.com is encrypted 
using TLS encryption. 

To function correctly, a VPNease server needs to be able to connect to 
management.vpnease.com at least once a week. Please ensure that your VPNease server can 
connect to management.vpnease.com (TCP port 443) normally to ensure proper functioning of the product. In particular, 
if you run your own DNS server, make sure that this DNS name resolves normally if you experience problems. 
  
----

== Does VPNease automatically close idle client connections? ==

VPNease does not automatically close idle client connections, because 
such a mechanism is difficult to implement reliably. Modern operating systems send and receive 
traffic through the VPN connection even when the user is idle. For  
instance, Windows and Mac OS X 
computers synchronize their system time with network servers, update RSS feeds, and poll for e-mail periodically. 
This makes detection of an idle connection difficult and unreliable. 

----

== Why is the VPNease web UI certificate reported as invalid by my browser? ==

VPNease server uses the HTTPS (HTTP over SSL) 
protocol for ensuring confidentiality of data between the browser and the server. 
HTTPS requires the server to be authenticated by a certificate. To ensure 
security, each VPNease needs to have a distinct 
certificate created when the product is installed. 

Dynamically generated certificate cannot have 
certification from a certificate authority such as Thawte or Verisign. Instead, 
the certificates are self-signed, presented "as is" as proof of identity. 
Another issue is that the server certificate contains a Common Name field, which 
should ideally match the domain name 
of the server. However, because a VPNease server can be 
accessed by both domain name(s) and often multiple addresses, the Common Name 
is set to a neutral unique value instead. 

When your browser reports an untrusted certificate from a 
VPNease server, you should first ensure that 
your connection to the server is secure (e.g. you are in your company intranet), and 
then add the certificate to the list of trusted certificates of your browser. 
How to do this depends on your browser. Finally, some browsers will still 
report that the Common Name present in the certificate does not match the URI 
entered. This warning provides essentially no increased security (as an 
attacker is fully capable of impersonating a specific Common Name). 

You can also create an RSA key pair and obtain a certificate for the public key
of that key pair from e.g. Verisign.  This removes certificate warnings on all
widely used browsers.
See [http://www.vpnease.com/administration-interface.html] for details on setting
the VPNease SSL certificate.


----

== My product update failed, how to recover? ==

Please reinstall the product from the installer CD, and select the recovery option.
The installer should recover your previous configuration for the new install.

----

== Can I use a VPN connection in Windows 2000/XP without administrative rights? ==

To configure a new VPN connection you need administrative rights to your computer. 
However, if a VPN connection has been configured to be available to all users, 
you can use (connect and disconnect) a VPN connection without administrative 
rights. 

----

== I get an error !#768 (encryption failed) when trying to connect using Windows XP ==

This error is typically caused by a problem with the Windows IPsec policy daemon, 
which fails to form an encrypted connection for some reason.  Please check that 
the IPsec service is running. 

Also please check that you have the latest service pack applied to your Windows XP. 
Windows XP Home Edition versions prior to Service Pack 2 (SP2) are not supported. 

----

== Can a single client computer have multiple VPN connections at the same time? ==

A single client computer can have multiple (simultaneously connected) active VPN connections. 
For instance, Windows XP and Windows Vista support this feature.  There are two issues that you 
should be aware of if using this feature: 

  * If you use both VPN connections for routing all traffic, there will be a routing 
    conflict.  Please check your client routing carefully. 

  * If two VPN connections get the same VPN address (assigned by the VPNease server), 
    the VPN connections may be succesfully established but be non-functional.  For instance, 
    Windows Vista will ignore the assigned address and configure an automatic address from the 
    subnet 169.254.0.0/16 instead, leading to a non-functional connection.  Check your 
    VPNease server settings to avoid this problem.

== What is the EU VAT ID? ==

EU VAT ID (also known as '''Value Added Tax Identification Number''', VATIN), is used in the European Union for
value added taxation for commerce within the EU.  In short, if you don't have a EU VAT ID, we cannot invoice
product licenses with VAT 0.

For more information, see:
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax_identification_number Wikipedia: Value added tax identification number]
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax_identification_number#EU_VAT_identification_numbers Wikipedia: Value added tax identification number, examples by country]
  * [http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/faqvies.do#item11 Taxation and Customs Union: Frequently Asked Questions].

----

== Safe and native mode in VPNease installer ==

When you boot the VPNease installer CD you can choose between safe and native installer modes.
Safe mode is the default since VPNease 1.2, and means that instead of a native graphics mode,
a VESA BIOS graphics mode is used by the installer and the product after installation.  This more
is compatible with more hardware than the native mode, which attempts to use a graphics adapter
specific driver.  Native mode provides better refresh rates, faster screen updates, better screen
saver support, and other benefits over the VESA BIOS (safe) mode.  However, since these features
rarely matter in a server, we recommend that the safe mode is used during installation.
