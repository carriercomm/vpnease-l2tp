	Added a workaround for the case where an IE user submits a form with a
	single field by pressing <enter>. Formal now automatically chooses which
	action to take when it can safely do so.

	Allow an application-specific CSS class to be assigned to a Group. The
	class is included on the root element of the group.

	Added groups of fields. A Group of Fields can now be added to a Form using
	the Form.add() method. Fields are added to the Group using the Group.add()
	method. A Group can also be added to another Group using Group.add()
	
	A Group is reresented by a <fieldset> element and it completely contains
	its Fields. A Group currently performs to validation of its own.

	Each Group is named, just like a Field, and the name must be unique within
	the context of the object it is added to (i.e. a Group of Form). The
	effect of the Group's name is that an extra "segment" is added to the Form
	data's dict keys to provide the namespace for Fields in a Group.
	
	For instance, if a Field, 'bar', is added to a Group, 'foo', and that
	Group is then added to a Form the field's data key is 'foo.bar'.

	This change introduces a new Form.add() method. It is intended to replace
	Form.addField() although that method still exists. All Form.addField(...)
	now does is forward the call to Form.add(formal.Field(...)).
	Form.addField() will probably be deprecated sometime.

	I may have slighty broken the default (and your) stylesheet with this
	change because I had been using a <fieldset> immediately inside the <form>
	element. That turns out to be unnecessary (any block element will do) so I
	decided to use a <fieldset> only for Groups to keep the <fieldset> nesting
	as shallow as possible.

	Added a ReSTTextArea widget. The widget accepts ReST-format input and
	includes a preview facility.

	Added a SelectOtherChoice widget. The widget is similar to the
	SelectChoice but includes an "Other ..." option and an <input> field to
	provide another value if the options in the list and not appropriate.

	Added ChangeLog. I should have done this a long time ago. Now I'll have to
	revisit the commit log and try to write something sensible here.
