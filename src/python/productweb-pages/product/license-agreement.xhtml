        </p>

        <p>
          6.1
          The Customer shall provide the Company with valid contact
          information including an e-mail address and see to it that
          the contact information is always up-to-date. The Customer
          is obliged to notify any changes in the contact information
          to the Company without delay.

          Any notice required to be given by the Company to the
          Customer pursuant to this agreement may be sent to the

          conditions of this license agreement. The changes shall be

          notice. If the Customer does not agree to abide by the

          agreement shall be unenforceable and/or invalid, such
          unenforceability and/or invalidity shall not render the
          terms and conditions unenforceable or invalid as a
          whole. Any provision determined to be unenforceable or
          invalid shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent
          permitted by applicable law. The Company will amend or
          replace such provision with one that is valid and
          enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, the
          original objective and intent as reflected in the original
          provision.

          <strong class="cb-bold">8. SUBSIDIARY APPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          8.1
          The terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply to
          the direct contractual relation of the Company and the user
          of the Software ("End User") as a direct Customer of the
          Company. If the End User has acquired its right to use the
          Software from a partner of the Company ("Partner") and has
          accepted an end user license agreement of the Partner
          ("Partner EULA"), the terms and conditions of this agreement
          shall apply in case the Partner EULA will be terminated or
          become invalid.
        </p>

        <p>
          8.2
          The Customer acknowledges that a Partner of the Company only
          has a limited right to grant rights to use the Software. The
          Partner EULA shall become invalid and the Customer's right
          to use the Software in accordance with the terms and
          conditions of the Partner EULA ceases as the Partner's right
          ceases. In case the Customer continues using the Software
          after the termination of the Partner EULA, the Customer
          shall have a direct contractual relation to the Company and
          the terms and conditions of this agreement shall apply. For
          avoidance of doubt, the Customer is also obliged to pay
          license fees directly to the Company in accordance with the
          Company's product pricing, published on the web
          (www.vpnease.com), as from the moment the End User has
          started or continued using the Software after the
          termination of the Partner EULA.

          way, even partly, started using it, whichever of these
          events occurs first. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
          Company shall not be bound by the terms and conditions of
          this agreement if the Customer has not provided the Company

          This license is valid against agreed payment of the license
          fee and is valid as long as the license fees are duly
          paid. When the due payment of any licensing fees is delayed
          for more than 14 days, the right to use the Software as
          agreed in the contract ceases until all due licensing fees
          and any possible interests have been appropriately paid.

          The Company may terminate this license agreement at any
          time, giving six (6) months notice. The Company may
          terminate this license with immediate effect in case the
          Customer has essentially breached the terms and conditions
          of this license and has not corrected the breach within
          fourteen (14) days from written notice.
        </p>

        <p>
          9.5

          Customer must immediately destroy the Software and all
          copies of the Software or any part thereof or material in
          written or any other form. The Customer is obligated to give
          a written guarantee of the destruction if requested by the
          Company.
