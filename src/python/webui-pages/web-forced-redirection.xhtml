            Your VPN access has been restricted because your VPN
            pre-shared key (PSK) has been changed, and you are
            using an old pre-shared key.  Please change your 
            VPN pre-shared key by logging in below and following
            instructions.  Once complete, simply restart your
            VPN connection.

            Your VPN access has been restricted.  This may be caused
            by an expired or exceeded license, or incomplete or incorrect
            configuration of the <n:invisible n:macro="productname" />
            server.  Please contact your administrator for further assistance.
