  * Automatic VPN connection configuration improvements.  Check and
    re-enable Windows IPsec and RasMan services if disabled, re-enable
    L2TP encryption if disabled, support for Windows 2000 and 64-bit
    Windows versions, avoid initial Windows reboot if possible,
    automatic Desktop shortcut, automatic defaulting
    of username, automatic administrative privilege elevation for Vista.
    Mac OS X Leopard configuration using a configuration template.
  * Site-to-site error feedback improved.  Address check failures caused
    by overlapping VPN subnets in client and server are now shown on web
    UI status page.
  * Installer improvements.  Recovery feature allows configuration from
    a previous installation to be recovered and imported into a new installation
.
    Installer now uses separate partitions for boot (/boot) and root (/)
    partitions if installation target is 4 GB or larger.  This improves
    compatibility with old BIOSes unable to boot from partitions larger
    than 512 MB.
  * Dynamic DNS improvements.  Addressing options now include forced address
    and NATted address of the server.  More providers supported.
    
  * External SSL certificate can be configured to reduce browser warnings for
    administrator and user web user interface connections.
    
  * Minor improvements to status views, other cosmetic improvements.

  * RADIUS authentication support.  Users can now be authenticated
    using a remote RADIUS server.  The Internet Authentication Service
    (IAS) component available for Windows servers provides RADIUS support,
    and allows existing Windows accounts to be used for VPN and web access
    authentication.
  * SNMP support.  VPNease server can now be monitored using an SNMP
    monitoring system.  A custom VPNease Management Information Base
    (MIB) module provides access to VPNease specific monitoring values.

    (available for 32-bit Windows platforms).
