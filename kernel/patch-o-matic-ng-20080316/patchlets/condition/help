This option allows you to match firewall rules against condition variables
stored in the /proc/net/ipt_condition directory. Multiple rules can match on a
single condition variable.

Example:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m condition --condition web_ok --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

To allow this rule to match:
echo 1 > /proc/net/nf_condition/web_ok

To disable this rule: 
echo 0 > /proc/net/nf_condition/web_ok

NB: it was /proc/net/ipt_condition on 2.4.
