This patch adds the ACCOUNT target

The ACCOUNT target is a high performance accounting system for local networks.
It takes two parameters: --addr network/netmask and --tname NAME.

--addr is the subnet which is accounted for
--tname is the table name where the information is stored

The data can be queried later using the libipt_ACCOUNT userspace library
or by the "iptaccount" tool which is part of the libipt_ACCOUNT package.

A special subnet is "0.0.0.0/0": All data is stored in the src_bytes
and src_packets structure of slot "0". This is useful if you want
to account the overall traffic to/from your internet provider.
