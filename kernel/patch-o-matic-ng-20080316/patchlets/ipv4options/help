This option adds an iptables 'ipv4options' match, which allows you to
match on IPv4 header options like source routing, record route, timestamp and
router-alert.

Suppported options are:
--ssrr
  To match packets with the flag strict source routing.
--lsrr
  To match packets with the flag loose source routing.
--no-srr
  To match packets with no flag for source routing.
[!] --rr
  To match packets with the RR flag.
[!] --ts
  To match packets with the TS flag.
[!] --ra
  To match packets with the router-alert option.
[!] --any-opt
  To match a packet with at least one IP option, or no IP option
  at all if ! is chosen.

Example:
  $ iptables -A input -m ipv4options --rr -j DROP
  will drop packets with the record-route flag.

  $ iptables -A input -m ipv4options --ts -j DROP
  will drop packets with the timestamp flag.
