== Virtual network bridge problems with VMware Server on Windows platforms ==

There are some virtual network bridge problems with VMware Server on Windows
platforms.  When the problem occurs, all network traffic from and to the
virtual machine is dropped by VMware, causing a network outage.  The problem
occurs randomly with bridged networking mode (which is the most typical mode
for VPNease).  VMware has not as of this writing (June 2008) confirmed or
fixed the problem.

VPNease 1.2 incorporates a workaround around this VMware issue:

  * The network outage is detected when all routers stop responding to ARP
    requests.  If this happens, the VPNease service is restarted in an attempt
    to fix the VMware bridge problem.  Usually VPNease service restart is
    sufficient to fix the problem.

  * If the problem persists, VPNease server will eventually reboot in an
    attempt to fix the problem through a reboot.

These measures are currently sufficient to work around the VMware bridge
problem in all known cases.
