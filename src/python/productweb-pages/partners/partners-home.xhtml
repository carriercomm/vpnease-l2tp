        <p>
          We are committed to mutually beneficial <n:invisible n:macro="productname" />
          distribution partnerships around the world and are looking for partners
          who wish to solve their customer's connectivity problems in an easy and
          secure manner.  We provide our partners with technical support, product
          information, sales materials, floating license keys, and a way to benefit financially
          from the cost effectiveness of <n:invisible n:macro="productname" />.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are two <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> partnership categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Service provider partners</strong> - 
            provide <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> installation, invoicing, and
            technical support for their customers.
            Service provider partners are allowed to price their <n:invisible n:macro="productname" />
            licensing without restrictions, and are awarded a partner discount based on monthly invoicing volume.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Installation partners</strong> - 
            provide <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> installation for their customers,
            but don't provide invoicing or technical support.
            Installation partners are allowed to price their
            installation services without restrictions.
          </li>
        </ul>
