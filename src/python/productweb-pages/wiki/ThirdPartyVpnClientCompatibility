----

== Cisco VPN ==

There are multiple Cisco VPN client versions with slightly different behavior.  VPNease and Cisco VPN
client can be used together in most versions.  When Cisco VPN client is stopped (exit the VPN client from
its Windows tray icon), Windows IPsec services are restarted, and you can use VPNease normally, and vice
versa.

----

== Safenet VPN ==

When Safenet VPN is installed, Windows RASMAN (remote access) service is prohibited from using IPsec
encryption: the RASMAN prohibitIpsec registry setting is set to DWORD value 1 in the registry.  This
prevents encrypted L2TP/IPsec traffic from working with the Windows built-in VPN client.  The condition
may persist even after Safenet VPN has been uninstalled.

Workaround: run VPNease 1.2 (or later) autoconfiguration.  The autoconfiguration tool re-enables all
necessary services.  For VPNease 1.1 (or below), the RASMAN prohibitIpsec registry value needs to be
set manually to DWORD value zero.  The registry path is as follows:
{{{
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
    SYSTEM\
        CurrentControlSet\
            Services\
                RasMan\
                    Parameters\
                        prohibitIpsec
}}}

----

== Greenbow VPN ==

Greenbow VPN client may leave Windows IPsec services disabled after uninstallation.  Please run
VPNease autoconfigure to restore proper service startup settings.  You can also restore the
settings manually from service settings.

While Greenbow VPN client is installed, Windows IPsec services will be disabled.  If you wish
to use VPNease and Greenbow VPN client on the same machine, you need to start and stop the services
as appropriate using e.g. BAT files:
  * When starting VPNease, BAT file !#1 should start IPsec services.
  * When starting Greenbow, BAT file !#2 should stop IPsec services.
