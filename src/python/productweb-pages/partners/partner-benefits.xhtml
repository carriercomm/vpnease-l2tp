        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Service Pricing</strong> -
            partner can price the service to their customers without restrictions.
            <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> licenses have no start-up fee,
            minimizing partner and customer risk.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Partner discount</strong> -
            partner gets a percentual discount based on aggregated total
            monthly <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> invoicing.
            Partner invoice is based on <a href="pricing.html">standard pricing</a>
            minus the <a href="partner-discounts.html">partner discount</a>.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Technical support</strong> -
            <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> provides technical support
            to ensure service provisioning goes as smoothly as possible.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Minimal support costs</strong> -
            because <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> is easy to install and
            does not require client software installation (leading to dramatically
            fewer software compatibility issues), costly on-site customer support
            is minimized.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Sales Materials</strong> -
            we provide our partners with
            <a href="service-provider-partner-sales-materials.html">sales materials</a>
            to help in their customer communications.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Floating licenses</strong> - 
            instantly usable pre-generated license keys allow customer service
            reactions without delay.  Floating licenses are activated promptly after
            service has been taken into use.
          </li>
        </ul>

            <strong class="cb-bold">Installation Service Pricing</strong> -
            partner can price installation service without restrictions.
            <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> licenses have no start-up fee,
            minimizing partner and customer risk.

            <strong class="cb-bold">Technical support</strong> -
            <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> provides technical support
            to ensure customer installations go as smoothly as possible.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong class="cb-bold">Easy installation</strong> -
            because <n:invisible n:macro="productname" /> is easy to install and
            take into use (server installation and client configuration is possible
            in less than an hour), installation service throughput is improved.
            Because there are no client software installations, there are minimal
           software compatibility issues to deal with in customer premises.
