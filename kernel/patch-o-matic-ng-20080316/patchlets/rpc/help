This adds CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_RPC, which is the RPC connection
matcher and tracker.

This option supplies two connection tracking modules;
ip_conntrack_rpc_udp and ip_conntrack_rpc_tcp, which track
portmapper requests using UDP and TCP respectively.

This option also adds an RPC match module for iptables, which
matches both via the old "record match" method and a new
"procedure match" method. The older method matches all RPC
procedure packets that relate to previously recorded packets
seen querying a portmapper. The newer method matches only
those RPC procedure packets explicitly specified by the user,
and that can then be related to previously recorded packets
seen querying a portmapper.

These three modules are required if RPCs are to be filtered
accurately; as RPCs are allocated pseudo-randomly to UDP and
TCP ports as they register with the portmapper.

Up to 8 portmapper ports per module, and up to 128 RPC
procedures per iptables rule, may be specified by the user,
to enable effective RPC management.


Usage:

  The intended usage of these modules would be with a ruleset like;

    # New session from client to server (portmapper get)
    -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p udp -m rpc --rpcs 100002
           -s ${client} --sport 0:1023 -d ${server} --dport 111
           -j ACCEPT

    # Continued session from client to server (portmapper answer)
    -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth1 -m state -p udp
           -s ${server} --sport 111 -d ${client} --dport 0:1023
           --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

    # New session from client to server (procedure call)
    -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -m state -p udp
          -s ${client} --sport 0:65535
          -d ${server} --dport 32000:34000
          --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

    # Continued session from client to server (procedure response)
    -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth1 -m state -p udp
           -s ${server} --sport 32000:34000
           -d ${client} --dport 0:65535
           --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT


  Which would allow rusers to execute from client to server;

     user@client# rusers $server

The RPC module also supports Legato NetWorker backup.
Legato NetWorker is based on both Sun RPC and REXEC (see RSH module).

Warning:

  RPCs should not be exposed to the internet - ask the Pentagon;
