Description: SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python
 SQLAlchemy is an SQL database abstraction library for Python.
 It's strengths are:
  * full power and flexibility of SQL. SQLAlchemy provides a full suite
    of well known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for
    efficient and high-performing database access, adapted into a simple
    and Pythonic domain language.
  * extremely easy to use for all the basic tasks, such as: accessing
    thread-safe and pooled connections, constructing SQL from Python
    expressions, finding object instances, and commiting object
    modifications back to the database.
  * powerful enough for complicated tasks, such as: eager load a graph
    of objects and their dependencies via joins; map recursive adjacency
    structures automatically; map objects to not just tables but to any
    arbitrary join or select statement; combine multiple tables together
    to load whole sets of otherwise unrelated objects from a single
    result set; commit entire graphs of object changes in one step.
  * built to conform to what DBAs demand, including the ability to swap
    out generated SQL with hand-optimized statements, full usage of bind
    parameters for all literal values, fully transactionalized and
    consistent updates using Unit of Work.
  * modular. Different parts of SQLAlchemy can be used independently of
    the rest, including the connection pool, SQL construction, and
    ORM. SQLAlchemy is constructed in an open style that allows plenty of
    customization, with an architecture that supports custom datatypes,
    custom SQL extensions, and ORM plugins which can augment or extend
    mapping functionality.
