This file is a history of changes made in each release.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.4, 10-SEP-2005

- Avoid use of linux __u8, __u16, __u32 types. Use standard uintN_t types 
  instead. This change is required because newer glibc header files warn 
  when some newer linux kernel headers are included by application code.

- Change RPC interfaces to use the recently registered official RPC 
  program numbers rather than numbers in Sun's "experimental" range.
  Be sure to upgrade client (management) apps in sync with ippoold.

- In the pppd plugin, Use pppd's allowed_address_hook to allow all
  addresses provided by ippool.

- Fix makefile bug where ppp CFLAGS weren't being defined properly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.3, 19-OCT-2004

- Fix build problems in some environments and improve build configurability
  (makefile changes).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.2, 15-OCT-2004

- Fix RPC requestor address check. ippoold was testing an uninitialized
  RPC variable, causing requests to be rejected unless -R was used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
V0.1, 12-SEP-2004

- Initial release.
