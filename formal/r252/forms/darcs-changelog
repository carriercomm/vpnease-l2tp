  * Use a label for the password confirm input and put i a new line.

Sat Apr  2 01:11:53 BST 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Use latest errors API and correct location of exception classes.

Fri Apr  1 14:29:45 BST 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Make the HTML valid. You can't have a block element inside a p.

  * Improve error handling and allow error to be raised from form callback
  The exceptions and handling of raised exceptions was changed quite a bit.
  There is now a better exception hierarchy that differentiates between form
  and field errors. Errors can now be raised from the form callback - either
  against a field (by providing the field name) or against the whole form.

Thu Mar 31 16:28:09 BST 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

  DatePartsInput is a widget that renders 3 inputs for entering a date. The
  inputs can be mm/dd/yyyy (the default) or dd/mm/yyyy by changing the
  dayFirst attribute.
  DatePartsInput was made the default widget for Date types.

Thu Mar 31 09:59:14 BST 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

Fri Mar 18 11:20:03 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add a txt file where i can dump a list of tests that are needed.

Fri Mar 18 11:18:07 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add some more forms to test the leaky behaviour just fixed.
  
  Yes, these should be tests but I don't have anything that tests entire form
  rendering right now :(.

Fri Mar 18 11:14:38 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Fix issue where validation errors from one form leak to other forms.
  
  When two forms, foo and bar, contained a field of the same name, wibble,
  validation errors were leaking between forms.
  
  The FormErrors instance is now provided with the failing form's name and
  the IFormErrors are removed early on in the rendering process when the errors
  are for a different form.

Fri Mar 18 00:17:38 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

Mon Mar 14 10:27:44 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Allow empty forms.

Sat Mar 12 11:05:10 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

Sat Mar 12 11:04:53 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Remove issue I just fixed.

Sat Mar 12 11:03:34 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

  * Allow the Choice blank to be removed completely.

  * Allow new actions to be added.
  The form can be provided with a callback but this does not add an action
  button.
  The new addAction button adds a callback against an action name. This adds
  a button to the 'actions' area of the form.

Fri Mar 11 12:04:35 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Pass the form back to the submit callback.
  It's etirely possible that the callback needs to inspect the form to do
  additional validation so let's pass it back.

Fri Mar 11 11:38:11 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Rename add to addField.
  This is mostly in anticipation of new stuff like addButton etc.

Fri Mar 11 09:51:14 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Oops. Add parseDate and parseTime.
  Also, remove the Structure class since it's not used yet.

Fri Mar 11 00:39:58 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Rename tests to what they are.

Fri Mar 11 00:37:34 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

Wed Mar  9 16:13:15 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Remove unnecessary code.

Wed Mar  9 16:12:34 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add widgetFactory helper.
  It's nothing more than a lambda but it makes Tim happy ;-).

Wed Mar  9 13:05:49 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add HTML editor back in.
  Add an htmleditor module to contain widgets and glue for the various HTML
  editors that are available. For now, it's just TinyMCE.

Wed Mar  9 13:04:58 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add errors to interface.

Tue Mar  8 00:14:47 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Rely on the modules to list the exportable attributes in __all__

Tue Mar  8 00:06:04 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Don't use <button> elements.
  Thanks to Microsoft for making IE the most f***ed up browser that exists.

Tue Mar  8 00:02:48 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Done these.

Tue Mar  8 00:02:05 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Example of adapting domain object for us in Choice widget feeding an Integer.

Tue Mar  8 00:01:12 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * If a widget factory needs args then use a lambda or other simple callable.

  * Add IKey and ILabel interfaces for listy type renderers to use.

Fri Mar  4 16:21:47 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Handle *any* child

Fri Mar  4 16:11:34 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Create the form post's action correctly.
  
  To avoid submit after submit after submit building up the URL, look to see
  if the last segment si the form post's action and if so replace that segment.

Fri Mar  4 15:38:30 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Switch back to old interfaces.

Tue Mar  1 02:09:44 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Assign id on choice widget.

Tue Mar  1 02:06:48 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>

  * Add self child resource so that I can test it "for real" at non-root.

Sun Feb 20 01:28:59 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Done these already :)

Sun Feb 20 01:28:39 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Be more explicit about the options type

Sun Feb 20 01:19:52 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Add ideas notes from old implementation.

Sun Feb 20 01:17:18 GMT 2005  Matt Goodall <matt@pollenation.net>
  * Initial import.
  Reworking of forms stuff with a nicer API (IMHO) and generally simpler.
