CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_LENGTH
TIME patch support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TIME
  This option adds a `time' match, which allows you
  to match based on the packet arrival time/date
  (arrival time/date at the machine which netfilter is running on) or
  departure time/date (for locally generated packets).

  If you say Y here, try iptables -m time --help for more information.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
